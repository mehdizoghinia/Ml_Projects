SL_Final_2.ipynb : Human Activity Recognition using Smartphone Dataset

The smartphone dataset consists of fitness activity recordings of 30 people captured
through smartphone enabled with inertial sensors. The goal of this project is to build a
classification model that can precisely identify human fitness activities.

Research Final 1.ipynb : Prediction of liver fibrosis

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects more than 170 million people worldwide. Egypt
has the highest prevalence of hepatitis C in the world with prevalence rates reaching 13%-
15%. Thus, HCV represents a major public health and economic problem in Egypt. HCV
infection is marked by high tendency to persistence and evolution to chronic hepatitis with
development of serious consequences such as cirrhosis and liver cancer in some patients.
The aim of this project is to use statistical learning to predict liver fibrosis by discovering
the hidden predictive patterns from medical databases.

researchFinal-3.ipynb  : : Heterogeneity Activity Recognition Data Set

The Heterogeneity Human Activity Recognition (HHAR) dataset from Smartphones and
Smartwatches is a dataset devised to benchmark human activity recognition algorithms
(classification, automatic data segmentation, sensor fusion, feature extraction, etc.) in realworld contexts; specifically, the dataset is gathered with a variety of different device
models and use-scenarios, in order to reflect sensing heterogeneities to be expected in real
deployments.
