#Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains a collection of small machine learning projects completed as part of the research topic coursework at Bishop's University.

##Project 1: Human Activity Recognition using Smartphone Dataset
Notebook: SL_Final_2.ipynb
The Human Activity Recognition project utilizes a dataset of fitness activity recordings from 30 individuals, captured through smartphones equipped with inertial sensors. The primary objective of this project is to build a robust classification model capable of accurately identifying various human fitness activities.

##Project 2: Prediction of Liver Fibrosis
Notebook: Research Final 1.ipynb
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects more than 170 million people worldwide, with Egypt having the highest prevalence of hepatitis C globally. This project focuses on leveraging statistical learning techniques to predict the onset of liver fibrosis, a severe consequence of HCV infection. By analyzing extensive medical databases, the aim is to uncover hidden predictive patterns for early diagnosis and intervention.

##Project 3: Heterogeneity Activity Recognition Data Set
Notebook: researchFinal-3.ipynb
The Heterogeneity Human Activity Recognition (HHAR) dataset collected from smartphones and smartwatches serves as the foundation for this project. The dataset is designed to benchmark human activity recognition algorithms in real-world contexts. It includes data from various device models and use-scenarios, reflecting the heterogeneities encountered in practical deployments. The project aims to develop effective classification, data segmentation, sensor fusion, and feature extraction techniques for improved activity recognition in heterogeneous environments.

These projects showcase the application of machine learning and statistical learning methodologies to address real-world challenges in human activity recognition, medical diagnosis, and data heterogeneity. Each project notebook provides detailed insights, methodologies, and results for comprehensive understanding and reference.
